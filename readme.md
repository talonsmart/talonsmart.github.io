# Website Portfolio
Welcome to my personal website and online portfolio, created by Talon Smart. This website showcases my skills and experience in web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Jquery.

## Technologies Used
I built this website using the following technologies:

- HTML: The standard markup language for creating web pages. HTML provides the structure and content of the website, allowing search engines to crawl and index the pages.
- CSS: Used for styling and layout. CSS allows me to control the visual appearance of the website, including fonts, colors, and layout. This helps to create a visually appealing website that is easy to navigate.
- JavaScript: Used for interactivity and dynamic effects. JavaScript enables me to add interactive elements to the website, such as animations, scrolling effects, and form validation. This enhances the user experience and makes the website more engaging.
- Bootstrap: A popular front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first designs. Bootstrap provides a set of pre-designed UI components and layout options that make it easy to create responsive websites. This helps to ensure that the website looks great on all devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
- Jquery: A JavaScript library for manipulating and traversing HTML documents. Jquery allows me to interact with the HTML elements on the website, enabling me to create dynamic effects and animations.

## How to Host
This website is a basic, static website, meaning it can be hosted on any server that supports static files. Here are two options for hosting this website:

1. GitHub Pages: GitHub Pages is a free service provided by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. To host this website on GitHub Pages, simply fork this repository, commit your changes, and push them to your forked repository. GitHub Pages will automatically build and deploy your website.
2. Self-hosted static server: You can also host this website on your own static server using a server like nginx. Simply copy the contents of the repository to your server's document root, and configure your server to serve the files.
